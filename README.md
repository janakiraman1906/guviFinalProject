# Cars Insurance Claim Prediction

1. We performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) by checking the first few rows, data types, summary statistics, and missing values.
2. We handled missing values by filling them with appropriate methods (median for numeric variables and mode for categorical variables) and dealt with outliers using the IQR method.
3. We converted categorical variables into numerical features using Label Encoding.
4. We selected relevant features based on correlation and domain knowledge for predicting the insurance claim amount.
5. We trained a Linear Regression model, made predictions, and evaluated the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
